install libraries the requirements.txt
run the solve_captcha.py file



Note: 
    Training an OCR model requires a GPU for faster processing and significant computational power.
    This simple model may not give the desired output

Also created a scripy with pretrained ocr model- paddleocr
To try this - run the paddle_ocr_solver.py file
